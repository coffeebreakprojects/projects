“” Yorii~~~ I’m beggin’ ya, can’t you do something?
“” The mixer with S Women’s Uni… 

“” So persistent. I’ve told you over and over, I’ve got my part time job that day so it’s impossible.
“”: Go find somebody else.

“” It’s not like last time where we’re just trying to meet a certain number of people. // The girls are specifically asking for you by name. // It’s just a part-time job, right? Can’t you do something about your shift?
	JPR/N: third bubble alt, “Can’t you change your shift?”
“” I’ve got a family I have to provide for.

“”: Isn't it just your cat?
“” Yeah that’s right, you got a problem with that?

“” As the only person here who’s known you since high school, I’ll be straight with you. // You’ve seriously changed… didn’t you used to play around with girls going from one to the next?
“” Maybe if you found your true love or something,but you still study seriously, hang out with friends from your circle and work part time. On top of all that you live with a cat… // It’s like there’s no room for a woman… 

“” You just want my leftovers anyway, don’t you? // Sorry, but they don’t exist anymore.
“” Give it up. See ya.

{} It’s true, there was such a time.
{} Without knowing what I wanted to do nor what I needed to do, I lived aimlessly… 


{} What happened with that woman may very well have been something I deserved.

{} It was easy and convenient for me to be nice to whatever woman approached me,
{} But that misplaced kindness hurt who knows how many people. I was a stupid brat.

{} For me, I think that meeting Goma
{} Was like the turning point in my life.

{} Powerless and ignorant,
{} I realized there are times when there’s nothing I can do by my power alone.
{} I remember that time so clearly.

{} Since then, my thoughts, actions and environment slowly changed, and it’s no doubt because of Goma.
{} There are still things I fumble over, but I believe I’m able to see my future and myself more clearly now.

“” Sorry for asking you to come in to work.
“” During Christmas, the busy peak times require a lot more manpower.
	JPR/N: literally, “...the busy peak times are bone breakingly difficult.”

“” No, there’s something I’m saving up for so you’re really helping me out.
“” Really? Whenever you’re here, the number of female customers we get noticeably increases. Maybe I should work you harder.
“” Please don’t say such brutal things with such a calm expression.

“” Uesugi-kun, // this is an assortment from the famous cake shop across the street.
“” I brought it as a reward for your hard work, so if you’d like, please eat it. ♡
“” Eh- ah, thanks… 

{} ーWell right now, just a little,
ST: There’s so many… 
{} Idle thoughts have been creeping in more and more… 

() I wonder if Naoe-san eats sweets…?
() He probably spent the night at work as usual, with nothing to do on Christmas.

{} Is the reason why he’s on my mind...
{} Out of sympathy… or something like that?
{} I kind of just can’t leave him alone.
 
 
Page 45

“” I said we should go out for drinks and before I knew it, it’s already this time of year now.

“” Thank you so much for listening to me ramble.
“” Even though it was mostly just me whining, // you’re the only one I can be honest with, Hatano-san.

“” I’m sure you have some peers that you’re comfortable with.

“” No~~~
“” I never know what those guys are actually thinking inside.

“” …But I’m the only one talking, you must be tired of it.
{} Hatano-san is one of my senpais from my university days.
{} He worked for a company before entering university, so there’s a significant age gap between us.

“” No, that’s not true. The complaints of a kouhai are cute.
{} Since back then, he’s had a calm personality with a gentle atmosphere about him.
{} He was surrounded by people younger than him and was well liked as he treated everyone as an equal. He’s someone I admire.

 
Page 46
 
{} We reunited after coincidentally joining the same company. // It’s amazing that we’re still able to go out for drinks like this.
{} That’s why when I heard about his marriage, // I undoubtedly believed that if it was Hatano-san, he’d be able to build a happy home.

“” I’d like to hear more about you as well, Hatano-san.

“”: About me?

“”: Well, I'm always talking about something boring or work-related, // Since you’re such a good listener.
“” Though it’s fine if you don’t want to talk about it… 

“” …I see.

“” So for example,
“” The reason why I got a divorce, or something.

“” Ah… well.
“” It’s fine, I never brought it up before, but after all this time it’s not something I’m trying to hide.
“” I’ve thought that I wanted to tell you the truth, Naoe-kun… 

 
Page 47

“”: I met my ex-wife through a business partner's introduction.
“” I know there have been all sorts of rumors spread by the gossip loving female employees.

“” That’s right… First things first, it’s not like I didn’t love my wife.
“” As a person, she’s a woman who’s worthy of respect.

“” Steadily building her career, I married her after being charmed by her sincerity when facing her work and private life.

“” At the very least, I thought it was going well.

“” It’s not wrong to say that our divorce was largely due to her affair. // The deciding factor was when she became pregnant with her partner’s child… 
	JPR/N: “partner” in this case, short for “affair partner”
“”: But,
“”: I'm the one to blame for causing all of this.
“”: Since she's a very intelligent person,

 
 
Page 48
 
“” I couldn’t hide it from her.
“”: The fact that I’m gay.

“” Brr~~~ It’s cold… 


 
Page 49
 
“” Haa… you’re so slow, Naoe-san… 
“” Huh, Yori-kun?

“”: What are you doing out here?
“” Could it be, you were waiting for me?

“” No… I just got back from my part time job.
“”: Ah, is that so?

“”: Look, I received all this from the people at my part-time job.
“” I got a lot of ‘em and since my sister’s in the middle of her diet, I thought I’d share them with you.

“” Ohh, Christmas cakes, huh?
“” Wowー they look delicious!

“” Actually, I was just out drinking but it didn’t feel like enough, so I bought more.
SFX: fwump
“” Let’s eat at my place.

“” Yori-kun.
“”: Hm?

 
 
Page 50
 
“” Sorry, it’s cold out, isn’t it?
“” Thanks for waiting.

“” Like I said, it’s not like I was waiting or anything.
“” I’m glad I bought a lot of alcohol.
“” Hey.

“”: …
“” If it’s cake, it’s gotta be champagne. // There’s snacks too, so beer would also… 

SFX: Snore-

“” Hey, don’t you think you drank too much?
“” I’m off tomorrow so it’s fine… 
“”: What do you mean it's fine…?

 
 
Page 51
 
() …Did something happen at work?
“” Wonder if there’s any anime on.
“” It’s kinda been a while since I’ve watched TV.

“”: Ahahahahaha.
SFX: laughter
“”: …
“”: It's boring.

“”: Hey, Yori-kun-
“”: Hm?

“”: What do you think about romance between two men?
“” Huh?

 
 
Page 52
 
“” What do I…? // I don’t really care.
“” Other people can do what they want, it’s got nothing to do with me.

“” What is this, all of a sudden?
“” Are you gonna get a male lover next?
“”: …

() Why is he so quiet?
SFX: Fwip
	JPR/N: personally, I’d go with “turn”
“”: Yori-kun, you…

“”: You say that it's got nothing to do with you,
“” But how can you say something like that?
“” How can you be so sure it doesn’t?

“” What if… there was a person in your life who was so attractive, it didn’t matter whether they were a man or a woman?
{} Wh… at?
“” If there was such a person, your eyes would follow them, right?

{} He keeps rambling.
“” For me… // I wouldn’t be able to deny it.
{} Who is he talking about?

 
 
Page 53
 
“” I’ve respected him since our university days.
SFX: Badump
{} Someone I don’t know.
SFX: Badump
“” Though he’s good at what he does and is always calm and collected, he gives me a push in the right direction in critical moments. 

“” When he smiles just for me, somehow I start to feel happy...
{}: Stop it.
{}: Don't say any more.
SFX: Badump

“”: But…
“”: It's no good.

“” All I’ve ever felt is admiration.
“” Something like that, after all this time… 

 
 
Page 54
 
SFX: Sit up…
“”: Fur…

(): Fur?

(): Not enough fur…

“” Oi… 
SFX: Wobble…
“”: Hanako…

 
 
Page 55
 
SFX: Bump

“”: Uwah!
SFX: Topple
	JPR/N: personally, I’d go with “tumble”

“” Ughhh… 
“”: Hanako…
“”: You've gotten so much bigger…

“” …kinda smells good…

ST: Lemme inー

“” Hey now, Goma-chan. // It’s cold in the hallway, so get in the kotatsu with onee-chan.
JPR/N: she speaks in third person POV here, common when speaking with kids / small animals
ST: Nya…

{}: …
{}: …

SFX: Haaー

“”: The worst…
	JPR/N: alt, “This sucks…” 

  
 
Page 59
 
“” …Iー
“” So… that’s how it is. I had… no idea… 

“”: Are you shocked?

“” …Yes.
“”: Well, I suppose that's to be expected, since I've always been pretending to be normal.

“” …I thought I could change if I got married.
“”: For so long,
“” I resisted being gay.
“” I wanted to prove that I could also properly love a woman.

 
 
Page 60
 
“” What resulted,
“” Was failure, and getting the people around me caught up in it.
“” I was the worst in the most a foolish way.

“” Don’t leave your mouth hanging open like that.
“” No matter what you think, it’s already over and done with, // And the fact that I’m gay won’t change.

“” …I’m not sure what to say…
“” I… when I think about how I didn’t know anything, I get kind of lonely… 

“” Hatano-san, as you were suffering because of that, // you didn’t let it get to your head and did your job perfectly. I can only see you as cool.

“” I’ve always thought it would be great if you were my boss, // So whether you like men or whatever, you’re still someone I admire.
“” Even in the future, I don’t think that’ll change.
“” That’s why I,

 
 
Page 61
 
“” Want you to become happy,
“”: No matter in what shape or form.

“” You’ve got me.
“” If you say it like that,
	JPR/N: less accurate alt, “If you put it that way,”
“” Just what kind of expression am I supposed to face you with?

“” Detaching yourself from the situation and drawing a line like that,
“” Is what pains me the most.
“” Even though I was only planning to confide in you that I’m gay… 
 
 
Page 62
 
“” You never even considered it, huh?
“” That you, yourself were my target.

“”: …
“” Eh…

“” ーWell,

“” Naoe-kun, your being dense and slow hasn’t changed since our university days.
“” I’ve always liked you, y’know?

“” Haー
“” Hatano-sa… 
	JPR/N: not a typo, trails off

“” Sorry, it’s not like I was trying to make you feel troubled.
“”: I really did mean to take this to my grave.
“” …I, too,


 
 
Page 63
 
{} “Since I honestly want the person I came to like to become happy,”
{} “I don’t mind if you pretend this never happened.”

{} Hatano-san’s seemingly sad smile etched itself into my brain, refusing to dissipate.

{} How could I, who was unable to make my girlfriend or anyone else happy,
{} Ever wish for someone else’s happiness?


{} It’s not like I’m anyone special.
{}: But if there's someone out there to prove that wrong,

{}: If I can become special for just one person,
{} I wonder if I’ll be able to live happily…

[] The Next Day

() Thank goodness I have the day off today.
SFX: Spacing outー
“” Feels like it’s been a while since I’ve seen a blue sky… 

“” Ahー

“” Yori-kun.

 
 
 Page 65
 
“” Sorry about yesterday.
“” I did it again… it seems I fell asleep. // But when I came to, it was already morning and I didn’t remember anything, but it seems like you cleaned up and put a blanket over me.
“” Thank you.

“” My memory is seriously so foggyー did I say anything weird?

“” …Nothing in particular.
“” Then that’s good.

“” That sure is a lot of bags for your day off. // Are you going somewhere?
“” A training camp with friends from my circle.
“” Now, at the end of the year?
“” It’s fine, it was my idea.

“”: Eh- how nice. University students have so much freedom…
	JPR/N: more accurate alt, “Ehー how nice, university students are so free…” 

“” I won’t be back for a while, // and I’m not sure how long it’ll be.
“”: What about Goma-chan?
“”: My sister's here, so it'll be fine.
ST: No, don’t go!

 
 
 
Page 66
 
“” I see... 
“” Well… have fun.
(): I don't even want to see his face right now.
“” See ya.

“” It’ll be lonely without you here, Yori-kun.
“”: So come home soon, okay?

“” …Just now.
“”: Hm?

“” What did you just say?

() His face… 
“” Ahh… have fun?

 
 
Page 67
 
“” But I think it’ll be lonely without you around, so,
“” I hope you hurry and come back soon.

“” You can’t just decide that on your own, idiot!
“”: Why are you so angry...?
[]: He came back in two days.
