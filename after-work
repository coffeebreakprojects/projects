[]: Live to work or,
[] work to live.
 
{}: Everyday I work overtime till the last train,
{}: and it's no surprise that I work during the weekends. 
{} An unreasonable workload given by an unreasonable boss,
{} Dealing with mistakes made by colleagues,
 

{} Slaving my days away for the company like a workhorse… society may call me a corporate slave, but it’s not like I consider myself enslaved by the company.
{} Lately, I’ve been talking to myself more and my hands have been shaking as I type on my keyboard,
 
{} And I feel like I might burst into tears upon returning to a quiet office alone……… 
{}: ......................
 
{} Still, I’m proud of my work.
 
{} If anything, you could say I’m turning this company around.
{} Be grateful for me, piece of shit.
SFX : tap tap
 
{}: I believe that all this hard work will be rewarded one day.

{} All I can do is be healed by my idols, who are my only source of support.
“” Yup, yup, I knew this little one would be able to catch it as she grew up.
 
{} That’s my number one, getting 100,000 followers in the blink of an eye.
{} Though as someone who’s followed them since they opened their account, I’m feeling a bit lonely now that they’ve become so famous.

“” Goma-chan

{} The owner has such a soothing voice, I’m sure she must be a cute girl… 
 
“” Oops, my Hanako is hungrily waiting. // This is no time to be working!
{}: My true love: Hanako
SFX: Clatter
{} I’m sorry, Hanako.
{} Right now, my heart is being swayed by a cute cat on my screen.

“”: Hatano-san.
“” Good work, you’re working late today.
 
“” Ah, yes. The deadline is approaching, so it’s been tough.
“” You too, Hatano-san, it’s rare for you to stay at the office this late.
“” Yeah, cause I don’t have to rush home like I used to.
  
“” I’ve had a lot of meetings with clients lately… 
“”:  Achoooo!
	JPR/N: I’d personally just go with “Achoo!” since the sneeze is not elongated in the text
 
“”: Excuse me
“”: A cold?
“” Use this if you’d like.
 
{}: Mask
	JPR/N: pretty sure this should be considered “st” (small text)
“” Try not to overdo it, alright?
“” Get some rest before you destroy your health. // Don’t overdo it just because you’re young. If your body gives out, you’ll lose everything.

“”: What's wrong?

“” Well…… I was just thinking that it’s been a long time since anyone’s been so kind to me.
“”: Thank you very much.
 
“” What, things aren’t going well with your live-in girlfriend?
“” Actually, we broke up. // There was a time when I didn’t go home at all and before I knew it she was gone. She kind of left one-sidedly.
“” Kind of, huh? 
 
“” I see, then that makes both of us heartbroken.
“” I just got divorced but it’s been a long time coming. Why don’t us single people go out for a nice, relaxing drink next time?
 
{} Everyone is different, to each their own.
“” Good work today.
{} Why should I be the only one feeling pessimistic?
 
{}: The world will still turn, and there’s still work tomorrow

“”: Hello?
 
“...”
 
{} Oi oi, your sanitary pads are totally visible through your bag.
“” I’m hurrying back as fast as I can.
“” Yeah, I’m almost home… keep warm and wait for me.
{} His girlfriend probably asked him to buy them since she can’t move due to her menstrual pains.
ST (sanitary pad details): Overnight // Leak proof
 
{} Yeah yeah, what a caring boyfriend you are to think about your girlfriend.
{} Meanwhile, I’m returning home after midnight with a bag full of hamster supplies.
() I hate good looking guys whose lives seem to be going swimmingly, but I digress.
{}: Things are not going well for this guy.
 
{} But that’s okay with me, because,
“” Come on, you want this sunflower seed, don’t you? You greedy little thing.
{}: I have Hanako.
 
 
Page 8
 
“”: Ah! You pooped!
ST(near Naoe): You cutie~
ST(near hamster): Don’t look at me
 
{}: This was the hamster that my girlfriend and I got when we lived together.
{} In the end, she got fed up with my being a workaholic and left me with Hanako.
{} Now I’ve found meaning in working to raise this tiny creature… 
“” Hm…?
“” Hanako, you… what are those two balls…?
 
SFX: Meowー
ST: Welcome home.
“” That was so freakin’ embarrassing.
SFX: shut / slam
“”: The cashier was a guy who wasn’t used to the cash register yet, and the plastic bag was the see-through type. // This is the last time I’m getting you sanitary pads.
JRP/N: more accurate alt for second bubble, “This is the only time I’m getting you sanitary pads.”
 
 
Page 9
 
“” Ahh, sorry. You really helped me out, thanks.
“”: You’re such a good younger brother
 
“”: By the way, Yori-kun, get this,
“”: There's an interesting follower on Goma-chan’s account
 
“” Even though they mostly upload hamster pictures, it seems like the owner is a guy. // Just when I was thinking that it’d been a while since he’s updated,
“” He said that the hamster that he raised like a daughter was actually male. // I feel bad for him, but I still laughed.
“”: Hmmm…
ST: Bro, you’re looking handsome today too.
 
“” Work… What am I going to do about work… 
SFX: cough cough
{} As expected, it’s times like these that being single is tough.
ST: his cold worsened

[] ーThree years ago, // back when I was still in high school,
“” Sorry it’s so late. // You’re the only adult I can ask, nee-chan.
JRP/N: I don’t usually TL things like “Nee-chan” since it’s like a name, and it shows character. “Big sis” is okay, but awkward, and “sis” is also passable, but too generic.
 
{}: I picked up a stray newborn kitten.
 
{} Injured and weakened by the rain… 
{} It felt like its life force could disappear at any moment. 
 
{}: At the time, my sister, who had already established herself, was the only one I could turn to.
{} My sister did everything she could to support me in saving the kitten.
{} Thanks to her, the kitten… Goma recovered.
{} After that, my sister continued to lovingly raise it at her place, living peacefully together.
 
 
Page 12
 
{} Presently, I’ve become a university student, and I’m staying in my sister’s apartment as a freeloader.
{} I help take care of the cat, and with my growing photography hobby, upload pictures and videos on the net.

You’re super cute today, too!
All my stress from work is gone (cat face)

(): Ah...
 
() Hamster Guy posted an update on his account.
“” As usual, his photos really suck.
[] We’ve actually known about his existence since a while back. // This is because,
Text on IG account: JPR/N: pretty sure this is twitter… lol.
Hanako
Good morning. I’m off to work. 
 
[]: He seems to be quite busy, as he doesn’t post as much, however // he usually responds to our posts.
“” He sent in a poem.
(Post Response:)
I want to bury my face in that chest,
And take a deep breath.

Though the sky I see through the gaps
Between the buildings is always gray,
When I think of you my world is filled with color.

For being born into this world,
Thank you.
Today, tomorrow, and the day after,
I’ll be praying
For your health and happiness.

 
“” He’s a bit weird, but he doesn’t seem like a bad person… 
[] No, he’s just creepy.
 
[]: That was my impression of him.
[]: But,
 
 
Page 13
 
(): If you look at the view outside the window // it looks like our neighborhood…
[] At first, it was little things.
 
[] Without meaning to, I noticed from the backgrounds of the photos,
[] compared to my surroundings, it looked coincidentally,
 
(): The kitchen…
[] Similar.
 
[] No, there’s no way.
Text on IG account: JPR/N: it’s Twitter
Good morning.
Working on my day off this week too.
[] It’s just a coincidence.
 
[] It seems somehow my intuition is terrifying. 
 
() Hm… hm?
 
 
Page 14
 
””: Good morning.
() A similar necktie and watch… 
“” …Good morning.
ST Returning in the morning.
 
() I’m pretty sure that’s the person who lives downstairs… I see him occasionally… 
[]: Normally, you wouldn't think to find someone this close
 
[]: A salaryman in his twenties
[]: Does seem to fit the bill but…
[] I can’t confirm it anyway.
(): Let’s stop this.
[] is what I thought.
 
[]: Ever since he’s piqued my interest, I find myself looking for him…
 
() Every time I see him, he looks so gloomy.
 
[] Is he resting properly?
SFX: Haa
[] It’s not uncommon for a corporate drone, slave to their accounts… 
 
 
Page 15
 
[]: I’m no longer curious if he’s the same person as the Hamster Guy, but rather, I’m concerned about his work life balance.
[]: Right now, rather than finding out whether he and the Hamster Guy are the same person, I'm more concerned about this person's work-life balance.
 
(): I wonder if they’ll increase my shifts at work // Camera accessories cost money... and I also want some new equipment…
“” Yori… 
 
“” I finally found you… 
“” Why didn’t you call me? // I’ve been looking for you all this time.
“” Huh?
 
 
Page 16
 
“”: As I thought, I can’t go on without you, Yori.
“” I love you more than any other guy in the whole world.
 
“”: Huh?
“” Eh, wait,
“” Who are you… 
 
“” Uwaaaaaahn
SFX: jolt
 
“” Oi, you’re bothering the neighbors. // Keep your voice down.
“” I won’t forgive you for breaking up with me, // so promise me that we’ll be together forever. // Otherwise I won’t move from this spot.
 
(): Did I date her before? But I don’t recall anyone this crazy…
“” Ahh… I got it, I got it. For now, since it’s already so late for today, next time...
 
“” Don’t try to brush me off like that.
() And she’s violent.
SFX Bashi: Bang!
SFX Gu: Stagger 
 
SFX Gyuu: Grab
“” Miss, calm down.
 
 
Page 17
 
“”: As an unrelated party, I apologize for interrupting so suddenly… // But please calm down and consider the time and place.
“”: Wha… What’s your deal?
 
“” As residents of the same apartment complex, we’re acquaintances. 
“”: Even though I caught only a small part of your conversation, it looked like you were one-sidedly saying whatever you want. // I stepped in since he was looking so troubled.
 
“” I’m sure you have your own reasons… but,
 
“” You’ve been loitering around this area for the past few days, haven’t you?
“” I don’t think it’s a good idea to be doing something like that… 
 
“” I… // I don’t know what you’re talking about!
SFX: Dash
  
 
Page 18
 
“”: I’m sorry for all this… // You saved me back there.
“” Nah, without a third party to intervene, these sorts of things can get out of hand. // I’m glad we got her to give up though.
 
“” You may not believe me, but… / That person… Even though I don’t remember her, she may have been someone I knew… But we really never dated or broke up or anything.
“” No, I believe you. She had a bit of a crazy look in her eyes.
() Good looking guys have it rough too, huh~
 
“”: Really though… I’m so sorry for getting you involved in such a troublesome matter.
“”: No, don’t worry about it. I’m also sorry for butting in like that.
 
“”: I’ve been having a routine of working till late and only going home to sleep, too 
“” For me, working until this late and only coming home to sleep has become my daily life.
“” Well, truthfully speaking,
“” At the end of the day, I feel like if I ignored that girl’s hysterical screaming, I would have a bad night’s sleep.
   
“”: This might sound weird coming from me, but…
“” You have to be careful how you handle women, haha… 
 
“” Well, that’s how it is.
 
 
Page 19
 
() If I see him next time, should I ask him about the account…? 
[] Supposing that he and the hamster guy are the same person,
[]: but, there’s no way that that's the case…
() It’s not like I want to become friends or anything.
 
[] But, just a little bit,
[] in the corner of my heart, I thought it’d be nice if it was himー
 
[] A few days later,
 
[] who would’ve thought we’d run into each other like this.
 
“” Oi, Yori, are you listening?
 
“” Eh, yeah.
ST: Drink up man
(): Looks like him.
 
SFX: Hahahaha… 
 
() Since he always wears a mask, // I don’t really know what his face looks like, // so I might be wrong.
ST: But
ST: I’m curious…
 
 
Page 20
 
“” What should we do next?
“” Everywhere will be packed since it’s Friday.
 
“” Should we call it a night?
“” Yori finally came, I don’t wanna go home yet~
 
“”: You’re way too forward!
“”: How about drinking at someone’s house?
 
“” Sorry, I just remembered something I have to do, so I’m heading home.
ST: Eh~
 
SFX: crunch… 
 
“” Oi, you over there, are you alright?
 
 
Page 21
 
“”: Ha......
 
“” Ah… from the same apartment.
“”: Hello.
SFX: Oh.
 
() I wasn’t wrong.
 
“” You look sick from the alcohol.
() It’s the first time I’m seeing him without a mask, but, // it’s completely different from how I imagined… 
“” Since we’re heading the same way anyway, I’ll bring you home. // I’ll call for a taxi,
“”: Can you stand?
 
“”: Eh… I don’t want to bother you…
“” I felt the same way, with what happened the other day.
 
“”: But…
SFX: Ugh.
 
SFX: blargghh~~
 
 
Page 22
 
[] Ahh… it’s been a while since I’ve done that… 
 
[] I know I’ve never been very good with alcohol, so I’ve been careful with my health.
 
[] That stupid boss of mine, making me drink until I throw up… I’ll sue you for harassment, don’t forget… 

[] Well, I didn’t refuse either… 
 
[]: Somehow, my body feels heavy…
 
“” Ah……?
SFX: yawn… 
 
“”: Haa-
TL2/N: beginning of the sneeze

“” Hachoo!
“” Gya
 
“” Ugh……… 
“”: Ah, you’re awake.
 
“” How are you feeling? // I’ve got water, want any?
SFX: dazedー

“”: Just so you know, this is my house. // I tried asking you for your unit number, but you were mumbling nonsense.
“”: So in the meantime, I let you in my place
“” And well… I saw the lock screen of the smartphone in your suit pocket. // Ah, it wasn’t on purpose, alright? I just happened to. 
 
“” But like I thought, it really was you,
“”: Hanako’s owner.
 
 
 Page 24
 
“” Why are you so shocked? // I thought you’d be happier.
“” I mean, do coincidences like this really exist!?! // Is this reality? Am I still drunk!?
SFX: slump
 
“” Not only did I bother my neighbor with my embarrassing disgraceful behavior,
“” To think you’re that Goma-chan’s owner… // You were this close this whole time… I can’t believe it.
 
“” In the first place, I didn’t even know you recognized my account…… // Online… I figured they’d get buried and you wouldn’t even see them, but you even noticed the weird poems and long messages I’ve been sending… 
() So you were self-aware?
	JPR/N: alt, “So you knew all along?”
 
“” Goma-chan is special.
“”: You may find it laughable that a grown man is so enamoured by a cat on the other side of a screen, but,
 
“”: I like him,
“” an unbearable amount… 
 
 
 
 
Page 25
 
“”: Such a round, adorable little creature…
SFX: Haa〜〜〜
“” Um… // C-can I pet him…?
“” Eh… sure… 
“”: ?
(): Is this person really alright…?
 
“” Ah~ all the power harassment from my damn boss and the deathly nights of working overtime, // and all the things I hate about my company were all for this one moment.
SFX: There, there.
“”: …
[] Starting to pity him.
 
“” Man, but it’s unexpected. To think you’re the owner.
“” From the feel of the videos, I always thought it was a woman.
 
“”: Sorry that I’m a guy.
SFX: pout
“” Well, it’s true that my elder sister is the owner, but I’m the one who took him in. // Now both of us raise him.
ST: My sister’s working now.
 
SFX: Ohhーー
“” What? What’s with that face like you have something to say?
 
 
Page 26
 
“” No no, I was just thinking that you never know what life has in store for you.
“” Since I’m feeling much better now, I’ll head home.
 
“” Really though, I’d like to apologize for today.
“” It’s fine, you’ve helped me too… 
 
“” That’s right, I didn’t get your name.
“”: I’m Naoe… Naoe Yoshihito
 
“”: Yori
“”: Uesugi Yori
 
SFX: Slam…

“” It has been decided that we will be meeting with C Company tomorrow at 2pm, so prepare the materials.
 
“” Huh… wait a minutー
 
“” Also, about the project with B Company, they’ve requested to reduce the number of staff due to a lack of budget so the workload will increase, but that’s fine, right? // We’ll be moving the due date up to XX month.
“” Another thing, I’ll be taking a week of paid leave at the end of the month, so I’ll leave the rest to you.
 
“” You idiotー didn’t I tell you to do something about it by today? // You’re really useless, aren’t you, you imbecile!!
SFX Kiiin: Screech?
SFX biri: shudder/tremble
 
“” I- I’m sorry.
“” Yamada again, huh… 
 
“” I can’t think of it as someone else’s problem~~~ // It reminds me of when I first joined the company.
“”: Back then, I was so stressed out I started having bald spots. Even now, I still get stomach aches…
“” In the past 3 years, I’ve learned the skill of looking busy so that I don’t get assigned any work.
“”: Who do you think is suffering because of your useless skill?
 
 
Page 30
 
“”: Right… yes.
“”: If that’s it, please leave the rest to us.
 
“” It’s an honor to receive such praise from you.
“” We’ll be looking forward to working with you again.
 
“” That’s right, I heard that Hatano-san was chosen to be the team leader for another big project.
 
“” I heard the other day that it seems he fixed something that the engineers hadn’t gotten to yet. // What would’ve taken a few weeks, only took him a day.
“” Ohhー I guess accomplished guys are different after all.
“” But it’s hard to believe that even though he’s doing so well at work, his marriage didn’t work out. // The rumor is that his wife has another man.
“” Eh? I heard that Hatano-san was the one who cheated.
 
“” You guys, let’s stop spreading those kinds of bad rumors.

{} is great news for an unmarried salaryman like myself.
“” It’s homemade, // but it’s better than convenience store food.
 
“” This is… amazing~~~ // Did you make all of this, Yori-kun?
“” This menu has been approved by my picky older sister, so I don’t think they’ll be bad.
{} How should I put it… 
{}: Is it really okay like this?
 
“” Every time I see you, your complexion looks awful. // What’s going to happen to Hanako if you drop dead somewhere?
ST: You called?
“” Your meals at least, eat something nutritious and then work.
ST: Delish… 
“” No, you’re completely right.

() Where did that initial unapproachable feeling go… 
 
“” Ah. This camera… 
“”: Hm?
 
“” You’ve got a pretty good one. // I’ve been working part time to save up for this same one.
ST: Do you mind if I touch it?
ST: Sure.
“” Yori-kun, are you into cameras?
“” Well, I guess… I’ve tentatively joined a photography circle at my university.
 
“”: Ehh.
“”: …...
 
“”: If that’s the case, then I'll give it to you.
“”: Eh-
“” I never use it anymore, it’s a waste.
 
 
Page 35
 
“” I bought it impulsively with my summer bonus, but it seems I don’t have much talent in the fine arts.
ST: Blurry
“”: Ah-

“”: Oh, but if you try to resell this, you'll probably get a good price…
“” Yeah, but I’d be more satisfied if you’d use that camera to take pictures of Goma-chan. // Moreover, I was thinking if you’re able to use the money from your part time job on food for Goma-chan, then that’s even more reason to give it to you.
 
“”: …thank you,

“” The data is still on here… // So you have a girlfriend, Naoe-san.
 
“” Ex, an ex, it’s all in the past.
“”: Oh!
 
“” Look here.
SFX: shift
	JPR/N: alt “slide”
“” This is the only photo of Hanako that turned out well, don’t you think?
 
“”: ………
“” Actually, after all this time, Hanako is a male, maybe it’d be good to change his name?
 
“” My live-in girlfriend was the one who said she wanted to raise Hanako.
“” It seems she actually wanted to get a cat, but since she’s allergic, we decided on a hamster and took in Hanako.
 
“” To begin with, my girlfriend didn’t know anything about the lifespan of a hamster, but… 
“” I remember her disappointingly saying, “How pitiful that it dies so soon,” after finding out its life expectancy.
 
“” Of course, to us humans, 2 or 3 years is a tiny lifespan, // but isn’t it strange for us to call them “pitiful” when they’re doing their best to live without any regard for their owner’s feelings?
 
 
Page 37
 
“” When you get a pet, you have to take responsibility for it… // but its value is so much more than that.
“”: I'm sure the same applies to dogs and cats.
“” I think whether it’s a human’s 80 years, or a hamster’s 3 years, they’re all equally valuable.
 
“” Although Goma-chan is famous for being a cat idol, // those early videos of him as a rescue cat,
“”: Now that I think about it, they must've all been taken by Yori-kun.
 
“” That’s right, but… you even know about those times, huh?
